# Nagarro-University-CourseManagementApp-JS

The goal of this assignment was to use REST APIs and HTTP request: every action on the front-end side will call an API endpoint so the action will be handled by the back-end as well.

The API calls were implemented by using axios library, the package json-server was used as a mock REST API and the db.json file as a mock database.
